# ML Library Implementation

I am trying to implement the functionalities of a ml library from scratch only using C++ standard libraries. Currently library can read data from .csv files only.

### Implemented features
  * Polynomial Features
  * SGD, SGD with momentum, AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam optimizers
  * Linear Regression
  * MSE, MAE, Huber Loss for regression tasks
  * Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net Regressions (as a loss function for Linear Regression model)
  * Binary Logistic Regression
  * BCE loss for binary classification

### Datasets used in examples
- [PolynomialRegression.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hussainnasirkhan/multiple-linear-regression-dataset)
    
- [BinaryClassification.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dragonheir/logistic-regression)
